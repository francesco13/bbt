    "# From Functions to Smart Contracts #  \n",
    "So far you have used functions to generate keys and handle transactions.  \n",
    "This way of writing code is called ***Functional Programming***.\n",
    "In this module, you will learn the basics of ***object oriented*** programming.  \n",
    "At the end of this module, you will be able to program smart contracts using ***Solidity*** - the language used on the Ethereum blockchain.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Functional Programming ##\n",
    "You can write a new function in Python as follows:  \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def name_of_the_function(inputs separated by commas):\n",
    "    some operations on the inputs\n",
    "    #any comments to make the code more readeble\n",
    "    return some value or values\n",
    "``` \n",
    " \n",
    "The keyword **def**  tells the system that a definition of a function will follow.  \n",
    "The new function:  \n",
    "- must have a name\n",
    "- can have some or no inputs, which have to be between brackets \n",
    "- can return some or no values  \n",
    "\n",
    "Use the keyword **return** to tell the system that what follows is (or are) the value (or values) returned by the function.  \n",
    "Use the character ***#*** to tell the system that what follows is a comment and not an instruction.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You can write your own functions to solve specific problems.\n",
    " \n",
    "For example, if you try to divide any number by zero, the system will complain, halting the execution of your program and dispalying an error message.  \n",
    "Try, for example: \n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(10/0)\n",
    "```\n",
    "You could write a function to handle this situation garcefully. For example, you can decide to return a zero in the event that users attempt to divide a number by zero.  \n",
    "```python\n",
    "def divide(numerator, denominator):\n",
    "    if denominator == 0:\n",
    "        return 0\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        return numerator/denominator \n",
    "```\n",
    "You can use this function for the following calculations:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(divide(10,5))\n",
    "print(divide(10,0))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise**  \n",
    "Write a function that, given an account, returns true if the limit has been breached or false otherwise.      \n",
    "Test the function with three separate accounts that represent all possible scenarios.  \n",

    "When dealing with money rather than generic numbers, certain functions may not be required, or indeed recommended.  \n",

    "> Just like everything else on the blockchain, they are immutable. Once deployed, the code cannot be changed; new versions of the same contract are issued as new contracts  \n",
    "> They can only access data on the blockchain; if external data is needed (e.g. prices of real assets) it can be pushed to the smart contract from the outside world\n",
