    "The Greek historian Polybius developed an algorithm based on the coordinates of a square containing all the letters of the alphabet to encrypt individual letters in the plaintext.

    "Substitution algorithms evolved over time to include longer shift keys. The Vigenère cypher (first described by Giovan Battista Bellaso but wrongly attributed to Blaise de Vigenère) but remained prone to frequency analysis, a cryptanalysis technique that exploits the fact that certain letters or sequences of letters occur more frequently than others in natural language.  \n",
    "Algorithms that always produces the ***same ciphertext*** are called ***deterministic***, as opposed to ***probabilistic*** encryption schemes that produce ***different cyphertexts*** every time they are used with the same parameters. A paper published in 1983 by S. Goldwasser and S. Micali first described a probabilistic encryption scheme. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Public Key Cryptography**  \n",
    "Public-key cryptography was introduced by R. Rivest, A. Shamir and L. Adleman in 1978. The authors were aware that the ***randomness*** introduced during the encryption process made their scheme ***probabilistic***. However, they did not explicitly stated that, as the concept of probabilistic encryption had not yet been introduced.   \n",
    "With symmetric-key encryption, the encryption key is the same as (or can be calculated from) the decryption key and vice versa.  \n",
    "Public-key encryption involves a pair of keys, a public key and a private key, associated with an entity. Each public key is published, and the corresponding private key is kept secret.  \n",
    "Data encrypted with a public key can be decrypted only with the corresponding private key.  \n",
    "💡 Public key encryption allows two people to communicate securely over an insecure channel (like the internet) without needing to share a secret key beforehand.  \n",
    "\n",
    "💭 *The public key can be shared with anyone, but the private key is kept secret.*  \n",
    "> If someone wants to send a secret message to the owner of the public key, they encrypt the message using the public key.   \n",
    "> Only the owner of the private key can decrypt the message.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example: Alice wants to send a secret message to Bob. Bob generates a public key and a private key. He shares the public key with Alice, and keeps the private key secret. Alice uses Bob's public key to encrypt her message, and sends it to Bob over the internet. Bob uses his private key to decrypt the message and read what Alice sent.\n",

    "💭 The beauty of public key encryption is that it allows two people to communicate securely without needing to share a secret key beforehand.  \n",
    "\n",
    "***Hashing*** \n",
    "It is useful to ensure the integrity of a piece of data, as any small change to the data will result in a completely different hash value.  \n",
    "💭 A hashing algorithm is a mathematical function that takes an input (such as a message or file) and produces a *fixed-size output*, known as a hash value. The output is a unique digital \"fingerprint\" of the input data.  \n",
    "A simple hashing algorithm can be built with the modulus function.  \n",
    "💡 K modulus M is the remainder of K when divided by M, where M is prime number (a number that is not the multiple of another number, i.e. cannot be divided by any whole number other than itself).\n",
    "> An efficient hashing algorithm is quick to calculate, produces a small hash and minimises the probability of conflicts.  \n",
    "> A conflict occurs when two distinct numbers (or other data aggregates) produce the same hash. \n",
    "\n",
    "***Digital Signatures***  \n",
    "Public key cryptography can also be used to generate digital signatures to guarantee the integrity of communications.  \n",
    "Here is the recipe to create digital signatures:\n",
    "> The sender of the message generates a hash of the message to be signed.  \n",
    "> The sender encrypts the hash with her private key.    \n",
    "> The recipient of the message uses the public key of the sender to verify the validity of the digital signature.  \n",

    "**A Primer on Functions**  \n",
    "This training will use Python functions extensively.  \n",
    "Functions typically take an input, perform some operation on it and returns the output.\n",
    "The function \"power of two\", for example, can be represented as\n",
    "``` Math\n",
    "y = x * x.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, y is the output, x, is the input and and the operation performed on the input is to multiply it by itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "x and y are variables as they will take whatever value is assigned to them. \n",
    "In Python variables can have any name as long as it does not beging with a number, and contains only letters.  \n",
    "Variable names are case sensitive\n",
    "To assign a value to a variable use the equal sign; the code below creates two distinct variables and assigns the value 5 to the first one and 3 to the second one:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "MyVariable = 5\n",
    "myvariable = 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also assign a string of characters to a variable, as follows:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "MyVariable = \"This is a string of more than 10 characters!\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the string of characters is between double quotes, to inform the system that you do not intend to create or refer to a new variable.  \n",
    "Strings can also be encolsed inn single quotes as follows:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "MyNewVariable = 'A different string.'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions in Python are represented as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def name_of_the_function(inputs separated by commas):\n",
    "    some operations on the inputs\n",
    "    #any comments to make the code more readeble\n",
    "    return some value or values\n",
    "``` \n",
    " \n",
    "The keyword **def**  tells the system that a definition of a function will follow.  \n",
    "The new function:  \n",
    "- must have a name\n",
    "- can have some or no inputs (between brackets) \n",
    "- can return some or no values  \n",
    "\n",
    "Use the keyword **return** to tell the system that what follows is (or are) the value (or values) returned by the function.  \n",
    "Use the character ***#*** to tell the system that what follows is a comment and not an instruction.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the function \"power of two\" in Python.\n",
    " \n",
    "```python\n",
    "def power_of_two(x):\n",
    "    y = x * x\n",
    "    #A comment: we used the variable y to hold the output, but we could have also returned x * x directly \n",
    "    return y\n",
    "``` \n",
    " \n",
    "Here is how the function can be used:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(power_of_two(3))\n",
    "``` \n",
    "\n",
    "The command ```python print() ``` tells the system to print whatever is within brackets. In this example it will print the number nine, having evaluated the function power_of_two(3).\n",
    "```python print() ``` is also a function. Please note that a function can take the output of another function as its input.\n",
    " \n",

    "If you try to divide any number by zero, the system will complain, halting the execution of your program and dispalying an error message.  \n",
    "In the next cell, try: \n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(10/0)\n",
    "```\n",
    "To solve this problem, you could write a function to handle this situation garcefully. For example, you can decide to return a zero in the event that users attempt to divide a number by zero.  \n",
    "```python\n",
    "def divide(numerator, denominator):\n",
    "    if denominator == 0:\n",
    "        return 0\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        return numerator/denominator \n",
    "```\n",
    "You can use this function for the following calculations:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(divide(10,5))\n",
